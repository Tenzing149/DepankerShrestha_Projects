**App Idea 5: TikTok Clone (TicTac)**

- **What**: TicTac is an app very similar to Tiktok in the sense that it streams videos to a device to provide constant and consistent entertainment. 
- **Who**: TicTac would cater mostly to those who have nothing to do in the moment as college students, whether they're in class or simply waiting for their clothes to dry. Everyone would be able to access it for their own various uses.
